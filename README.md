Two-dimensional (2D) multivariate kernel density estimate plotter. This program requires the free MATLAB Runtime Compiler.

The GUI requires installation of the free MATLAB Runtime. GUI release 1.70 requires MATLAB Runtime Compiler 2018b version 9.5. There are separate compilers for macOS and Windows. Install the compiler first, then run the .exe (Windows) or .app (macOS).

Here are the links for the compilers (click to start download). Follow all of the default settings to install. Nothing will happen following installation -- there is no need to open the compiler -- HafniumPlotter will access it automatically.
